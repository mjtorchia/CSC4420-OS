*******************************************************


*Install FUSE 2.9.5
-In my zip folder move the FUSE-2.9.5 folder to your desktop
-Now open your terminal and type into the command line "cd ~/Desktop/fuse-2.9.5" this should move you into the fuse folder on your desktop
-Then type "sudo ./configure"
-Then "sudo make"
-Then "sudo make install"
-After that if everything installed correctly when you type "fusermount --version" in the command line it will tell you version 2.9.5 is installed

*Install S3FS 1.74
-Before installation you'll need to create an Amazon S3 account at this link http://aws.amazon.com/s3/
-Once you create an account you'll want to log in and then at the top there'll be a drop down menu called "Services" under that find the service called "S3" and click on that
-Once there use the button at the top called "Create Bucket" to create a bucket
-Next in the zip folder I provided for you move the s3fs-1.74 folder to your desktop
-Before installing s3fs you'll need to install some other tools first. So in the command line you'll want to type these commands using "sudo" before all of them

apt-get install build-essential
apt-get install libfuse-dev
apt-get install fuse-utils
apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev
apt-get install libxml2-dev
apt-get install mime-support

-After that in order to make sure everything is installed type this command into the command line

sudo apt-get install libfuse-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libxml++2.6-dev libssl-dev

-Now you'll want to move into the s3fs folder. In the command line type "cd ~/Desktop/s3fs-1.74". That should move you into the folder
-Then type into the command line "sudo ./configure --prefix=/usr"
-Then "sudo make"
-Then "sudo make install"
-S3fs should be installed on your machine now

*Install OpenSSL
-In the zip folder, find "openssl-1.0.1s" and move that folder to your desktop
-In the commnad line type "cd ~/Desktop/openssl-1.0.1s"
-Type "sudo ./config"
-Type "sudo make"
-Type "sudo make test"
-Type "sudo make install"
-OpenSSL should be installed on your system now

*Setting up your bucket
-Go back to your Amazon bucket management page. https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home?region=us-west-2
-Now at the very top right you should see your account name. Clicking that will show a drop down menu. In that menu click "Security Credentials"
-If you get a pop up window click "Continue to Security Credentials"
-Click the Plus sign (+) next to "Access Keys (Access Key ID and Secert Access Key)"
-In that menu click "Create New Access Key" and download that file and extract it to your desktop
-In that file you'll have 2 lines of text "AWSAccessKeyId" and "AWSSecretKey".
-In your command line type "cd ~" to move into your home folder
-Next type "sudo nano .passwd-s3fs"
-And in that text file you want to copy and paste the values of "AWSAccessKeyId" and "Access Keys (Access Key ID and Secert Access Key)" like this

"AWSAccessKeyId":"Access Keys (Access Key ID and Secert Access Key)"

-Save that file and close it
-Next type in the command line "sudo chmod 600 .passwd-s3fs"

*Mounting the bucket
-Type in the command line "cd ~/Desktop/s3fs-1.74"
-Type "sudo make"
-Type "cd src"
-Type "sudo ./s3fs <Name of your bucket here> /mnt -d -o allow_other"
-Type "cd ~/Desktop"
-The bucket should be mounted now

*Testing the bucket
-In the zip folder I've included a text file and two image files (small.gif and shark.jpg). Move all of them to your Desktop
-(If you're not in the desktop, in the command line type "cd ~/Desktop")
-Type in the command line "mv Progress_log.txt /mnt"
-Now when you go to your bucket in the browswer, refresh the page, and when you try to open the progress log. It should be encrypted
-In the command line type "cd /mnt"
-Type "cat Progress_log.txt"
-This should display the log decrypted
-Type "mv Progress_log.txt ~/Desktop"
-Type "cd ~/Desktop"
-Now the progress log should be back on your desktop decyrpted

-Type "mv small.gif /mnt"
-Refresh your bucket page in your browswer and try to open the picture. It should be encrypted
-In the command line type "cd /mnt"
-Type "eog small.gif"
-The picture should show up decyrpted
-Close the picture
-In the command line type "mv small.gif ~/Desktop"
-Type "cd ~/Desktop"
-The picture should be back on your desktop decrypted

-In the command line type "mv shark.jpg /mnt"
-Refresh your bucket page in your browswer and try to open the picture. It should be encrypted
-In your command line type "cd /mnt"
-Type "eog shark.jpg"
-Only a chunk of the image should appear.
-Close the picture
-In the command line type "mv shark.jpg ~/Desktop"
-Type "cd ~/Desktop"
-The image should be on your desktop with only that same chunk decrypted

*Unmounting the bucket
-Make sure you are not currently in the bucket

-Type "df"
-If you dont see "s3fs" the bucket is unmounted
-Follow the mounting steps above to remount it
