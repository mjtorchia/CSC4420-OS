Unpacked and installed the FUSE and s3fs package. I encountered some errors
installing both of them. I had to try a few different versions of each before
I was able to get them to work. The error I kept getting was
 "No package <package> found" but after looking at some fourms I was able to
get everything installed and got the bucket mounted

Installed the openSSL package. I've beent trying to get a feel for the code for
both FUSE and s3fs by inspecting the source code for each but am feeling very
lost as to what I even need to do to start making progress on this project.
I'm able to upload and download files to the bucket via my command line.
I still have to try to figure out what code I need to modify. Or if I need to
be adding functionality to the source code? I'm still going to have to try to
figure that out this week. Overall I feel incredibly lost on this project and
really have no idea what I'm doing. I'm really not even sure what tests to run
on the code or how to run them.

So I've been trying to place some trace information into the read and write
functions in s3fs.cpp to see if I can understand how the data is moving but
they havent been working. I'm also certian that I'm misunderstanding something.
Althought I dont feel completely lost in the project anymore. Moving and
copying to and from the /mnt all works fine (to be expected). I'm just going
to have to keep digging through the source codes. The method I've been using
is to just use the "Find Implementation of:" tool in code::blocks in whatever
function I'm trying to dig through. I'm just going to have to continue with
that and see how this week goes. If I come up with a handful of questions
I'll go to lab to see if I cant get some help.

Based on your email where you told us to keep digging in the write and read
functions, both read, write and open functions in s3fs take me to 
fdcache.h/fdcache.cpp so I'm pretty sure the data flows here but for the
life of me I cannot get any trace information to show up so I'm still not
sure exactly where it happens. I've put things like "cout << "testing" << endl;"
and "printf("testing \n")" in all the functions I suspect to be involved
in data flow but nothing shows up. I'll keep trying to see if I can 
get something to work. Hopefully I can make a breakthrough soon because
I'm running out of time

So after reading your email about "which s3fs" I realized I've been executing
the code in /usr/bin/s3fs and not the code I've been modifiying. So now that
I addressed that issue all the trace information I put in my fdcache file is
now showing up. I have it write to the syslog file. So now I just have to
pinpoint exactly where the upload and download is happening. I'm almost sure
its in the read and write functions but I need to be sure. Once I'm sure I
just need to implement the RC4 library from openSSL and I should be on my way.
Hopefully this will be done by the time I present on monday. I also need to
add the current directory to the executable path

Demo'ed my code today after class. I was able to upload from a browser and have it
show in my mount folder. Althought when I tried to edit it locally it would be 
encrypted because s3fs would expect that file to already be encrypted so when
it ran thought the decyption function in read() it would encrypt it. I was also
able to move a text file and a picture to the bucket and have them encrypt
successfully. I did find a bug though when trying to view the picture from the
/mnt folder. What is suppose to happen is when I try to open it I will decrypt
the picture for me and let me view it. It only decpyted a chunck of the file.
I think its because I defined size to be 4KB in the read function. I'll have
to fix that so it runs the function on the whole file. Other than that everything
run smoothly.
